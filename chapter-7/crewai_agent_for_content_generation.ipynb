      "### Step 1: Install Docker on Your System\n",
      "\n",
      "Before installing Apache Ignite on Docker, you need to install Docker on your system. You can download the Docker installer from the official Docker website and follow the installation instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Docker is installed, you can verify that it is running by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing the following command:\n",
      "\n",
